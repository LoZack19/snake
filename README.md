# Snake
This is a game I wrote on a computer with no GUI and less than 512 MB of RAM. It's an absolute disgrace, I wrote it when I already had enough experience and that makes it an even bigger disgrace. My excuse is that I wasn't used to working with vim and I didn't want to write anything big, I just wanted to pass the time.

It's a huge megafile with everything you need to make the game work inside it - apart from ncurses which... I mean... if you don't have ncurses go get a life and download it-.

Anyway it's pretty well optimized (isn't it?) and passed all the tests on gcc's and clang's static analyzer and gcc + valgrind's memory sanityzer, so well, I'm pretty satisfied. If you feel like rearranging it into multiple files push away, if it works I'll accept everything.
